# Welcome, new coder.
# Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!'
# to the console (the panel on the right)

print("1. Hello");
print("3. Dhivya's Python Code!");
print ("4. Printing a number:"); 
print (25);
print ("4.Bonus: Adding 2 numbers:"); 
print (20 + 50)
print ("6. first message" + " " + "Second message on same line")
print ("7. \"Nevermore\" - Printed the quotation marks using backslash which is an escape character ")
print("""8.
-->This message is split into 
   Multiple Lines, because 
I am using 3 quotation marks <--
""")
# Next, PLAY!
# Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

#   1. Change the message that is printed.
#   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
#   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
#   4. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
#   5. Print multiple messages one after the other.
#   6. Print two messages on the same line.
#   7. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
#   8. Other. You choose!
